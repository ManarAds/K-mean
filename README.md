This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into k distinct clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the cluster centroids to minimize the variance within each cluster, providing a partitioning of the dataset where similar data points are grouped together.
